### A Blog, Hopefully

*What's this?*

My attempt to put together an API for storing and retrieving blog posts, as well as a client SPA to consume it.

The back-end is your average Node/Express RESTful API. Postgres + KnexJS handle database calls.

The front-end will be a pure javascript single page application with routing and possibly a state container, depending on whether a case can be made for adding one.
